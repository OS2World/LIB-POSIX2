There appears to be a bad incompatibility between Unix and OS/2 port of
CVS (current version ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/util/cvs1107.zip):

Files with CR LF in it, checked in from a Unix host will become CR CR LF
when checked out with the above OS/2-cvs.

If you do so, then you have to fix the whole source tree with the provided
fixtxt utility in this directory.

I assume you have emx/gcc and gnu find installed for the following:

1. compile the fixcrcr utility:
	cd "this_toplevel_directory"
	gcc -Zexe -o fixcrcr.exe fixcrcr.c

2. fix the tree (the \OS2\FIND.EXE will NOT work!!!):
	\emx\bin\find . -type f -exec fixcrcr {} ;

3. remove the garbage fixcrcr.exe.tmp file in the toplevel directory.

WARNING: The find command will apply fixcrcr to ALL files in the tree, and
will thus also destroy existing binaries. If you have updated the tree
from the repository, you have to "make clean" before recompiling, otherwise
you will produce defective files.

When submitting patches: First fix defective ASCII with fixtxt. 

In toplevel (CVSROOT) directory:

1) Run make distclean! 

2) cvs -z4 update

3) cvs -z4 diff -udw >diff.out

<P><H2>Introduction</h2>

<P>This article describes the ability to use GNU configure scripts within the
OS/2 environment.  These configure scripts are a key tool in permitting the
automatic configuration of source code among a wide divergence of Unix
systems.  Extending their use to OS/2 opens the possibility of much more
high quality and easily available software than we might otherwise enjoy.
People have been porting Unix applications to OS/2 for years and this
article hopes to help continue this practice by making the task a bit
easier.

<P>Of course if you are using a Unix script to configure and port Unix
applications and utilities you might expect that the tools would depend
upon a Unix environment.  And this is indeed the case.  Luckily pioneers in
this effort have already developed most of the tools needed to establish a
Unix environment for you.  Names like Eberhard Mattes (The E and M of EMX)
and Kai Rommel have already built many of the tools that you may need.
Eberhard has supplied and continues to enhance a Unix-like linkable shared
library layer plus a modified version of the GNU C compiler that supports
most of the syntax and semantics of the Unix C language.  While EMX
supplies GCC as part of the installation there is no reason to believe that
it requires GCC in order to work.  EMX itself is a set of libraries that
could be linked to any C or C++ compiler.  Kai Rommel has used EMX to port
many of the Unix utility commands into the OS/2 environment as well.  These
commands are needed both by the configure scripts and by many of the Unix
makefiles.  Many other people have contributed to this effort as well and
many Unix-like commands are available from other sources.

<P><H2>Using The KSH Shell</h2>

<P>In order to run the configure script you will need a Unix shell.  This
article describes the KSH shell currently released on hobbes and many other
FTP sites.  It is freely available and you can also obtain the source if
you wish to build a modified copy for you own use.  Unlike many of the
earlier porting efforts of Unix code the OS/2 version is fully integrated
into the source thus providing you the assurance that when the source
changes, the OS/2 variants will be carried forward.  The sources themselves
are called pdksh, the public domain korn shell, and implement a very good
emulation of the original AT&T Korn shell plus many POSIX enhancements.
The configure script itself, however, does not require any Korn shell
features but rather depends on the older Bourne shell syntax and semantics,
of which a Korn shell is a superset.  You should be able to use any good
implementation of a Bourne shell to run this script.

<P>The shell itself can be called any name you wish.  Its behavior does not
vary based on the name unlike some other Unix shell programs.  To run the
configure script it should be named sh.exe.  Using the sources you can
build many different variations of the shell using options in the
<CODE>config.h</code>
file.  A full-blown Korn shell can be built or a complete subset that
behaves very much like a Bourne shell.  The smaller version is excellent
for script support.  In the run time release I have provided the full shell
under the name
<CODE>ksh.exe</code>
and the smaller version under the name
<CODE>sh.exe</code>.

<P>Configure scripts assume the presence of Unix commands so you will need to
insure that you have the correct selection available for the shell and that
they are in your current search path.  If you get command not found errors
when running the script you will need to find (and download if necessary) a
copy of the appropriate command.  There are several Unix commands that have
exactly the same names as OS/2 commands so be sure the Unix versions are
earlier in the search path.

<P>In Unix an executable is tagged with an attribute to make it known to the
system as an executable.  In OS/2 this is done with an extension.  This can
lead to unique problems when running the configure scripts.  KSH knows all
of the standard OS/2 extensions plus .ksh and .sh; and, as a special
feature, it can even run commands that do not have any extensions.  Most
often commands in Unix do not have any extensions and scripts either have
no extension or use the name of the shell as an extension.  This is only a
Unix convention, not a requirement, and to execute a Unix command you must
type the exact filename. In OS/2 the .ksh or .sh extension tells the KSH
that this is an executable shell script.  A file without an extension may
be either a script or a binary executable.  Scripts need not necessarily be
a KSH shell scripts however.  The standard Unix
<CODE>#!</code>
line at the top of the
file determines the actual command that will be used to run the script.
Should the same filename with a different extension exist in the same
directory KSH will use the extension specified in the script or if no
extension is specified then the search order is, no extension, .ksh, .sh,
.cmd, .exe, .com, .bat.  Note that if the script specifies a different
extension than one of the ones listed it will not be recognized as an
executable by KSH.

<P><H2>Running Unix GNU Configure Scripts</h2>

<P>KSH can be used to run GNU configure scripts, however, I can't guarantee
that the results will match the true configuration for OS/2 since this is
dependent on the way the individual configure scripts are written.  You
should expect that you may have to hand modify the configure script, the
results of the configure, or at the very least check the results to insure
that they look reasonable.  Even in Unix itself the scripts may not always
correctly identify a particular idiosyncrasy of a particular hardware
platform configuration.

<P>To set up to run configure scripts you will need to have a copy of KSH
called
<CODE>sh.exe</code>
somewhere in your path and, of course, you should be running
within a KSH shell.  One of the very early things done by most configure
scripts is to try and figure out the compiler.  This will usually fail
since it generally depends on setting the IFS (To understand why, see
discussion in the KSH
<CODE>readme.os2</code>
file on colon versus semicolon as a path
separator).  To work around this problem simply set CC to the compiler you
want to use prior to running the script.  For example to use gcc use the
command:
'<CODE>export CC=gcc</code>'.
Most configure scripts couldn't figure out the
names of OS/2 compilers anyway.  Now you should be able to simply type
'<CODE>configure</code>'
and watch it work.  If it seems to fail right off the bat and
can*t seem to find any commands look in the script and see if PATH is being
set by the script.  If it is, please just delete that line and try again.

<P>At some point the configure script will build a config.status script to
perform the final step.  If this is not run using
'<CODE>sh -c config.status</code>'
or
some such command in configure, then it will fail since .status is not an
OS/2 legal executable suffix.  You can run it manually however by typing
'<CODE>ksh config.status</code>'.
This is the command you should use if you need to run
<CODE>config.status</code>
later.  If you have problems you should inspect the
<CODE>config.status</code>
script and fix it as required.  Using the command:
<CODE>ksh -x config.status</code>
will echo the lines as they are executed which should aid in
debugging.  Running
<CODE>config.status</code>
is a good way to reset any of the changes
you may have made to
<CODE>config.h</code> or the
<CODE>Makefile</code>.

<P>Many configure scripts actually build and execute small programs to test
for certain features of the operating system or compiler.  In OS/2 using
EMX, the final link step for a program must have the .exe extension tied to
the executable name or the linker will not link correctly.  A few configure
scripts already know about this requirement and will work OK, but,
unfortunately most do not.  You may need to modify the configure script to
insure the correct executable name.  Once the program is built it can be
renamed to a name without an extension if KSH is being used to run it since
often the script also checks to see if a file with this name was created by
the compiler.  A line similar to the following may work for you if you are
using a version 2.0 configure:

<PRE><SMALL>
ac_link='${CC-cc} -o conftest.exe $CFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $LDFLAGS \
conftest.$ac_ext $LIBS && mv conftest.exe conftest'
</pre>

</FONT>

<P>This trick takes advantage of KSH's ability to run a command without an
extension.  Even with these changes you may still find that configure does
not correctly identify some OS/2 features.  Many configure scripts reuse a
line like ac_lnk many times over the course of running the program, however
some scripts use unique names each time they build a test program.  For
these configure programs it may be impractical to modify the script.  EMX
has a feature that permits it to attempt to fake this requirement for
makefiles and configure scripts.  By setting a compiler variable (usually
LD, see EMX documentation for details) to include -Zexe you can force the
link step to build an executable with the .exe extension on it and to
create an empty file with just the name.  This empty file is meant to
satisfy Unix makefiles and may fool configure scripts as well.  I say *may*
because some configure scripts not only check for the existence of the
executable name but also expect it to have size!  These configure scripts
wont be fooled.

<P>Unfortunately the KSH ability to run a file without an extension can cause
a conflict with the EMX feature to automatically build two files with the
same name but a different extension.  KSH will try and execute the dummy
file and will fail.  There are several ways correct this problem.  If you
know the name of the file then an easy solution is to define an alias for
KSH use.  For example the command
*<CODE>alias prog=prog.exe</code>*
would always
execute
<CODE>prog.exe</code>
even if a file named
<CODE>prog</code>
were present.  For permanent use
this alias could be defined in your KSH startup file.  Use of an alias is
supported by both KSH and SH but is not exported to a script.  Aliasing
must be reestablished in each child.  Should a more permanent or automatic
solution be desired, I would recommend getting a copy of the KSH source
file and customizing the
<CODE>exec.c</code>
file to alter the search order.  A working
example of a search order for configure scripts using the -Zexe option to
EMX might be (where . represents a file name without an extension):  .ksh,
.exe, ., .sh, .com, .cmd, .bat.  You may prefer .com ahead of .exe.  While
this search order wouldn't be intuitive to interactive use it does have
merits for scripts.  It is also possible to modify KSH so that zero length
files without an extension would be ignored, and, if there is sufficient
interest, I could modify the next version.

<P><H2>Building The Executable</h2>

<P>Once you have gotten configure to successfully run, you should find a
config.h file containing the platform customization flags and a makefile in
the directory containing the sources.  You may need to edit the config.h
file either now or as a result of errors that you define during your
compilation attempt.  In addition you will probably need to edit the
Makefile.  Makefile edits depend somewhat on which make command you use.  I
usually use either make from GNU or nmake from IBM.  Both are available
from hobbes.  At the very least you should insure that the executable name
ends with the .exe extension or modify the gcc flags to include -Zexe.

<P>It is likely that even with all of the changes and customizations you will
still need to put some #ifdef statements in the source to get it to perform
correctly for OS/2 use.  I usually include a -DOS2 option in my makefile
GCC compiler flags to permit a
<CODE>#ifdef OS2</code>
line to be interpreted correctly
in the source.  Other choices include adding a
<CODE>#define</code>
line in
<CODE>config.h</code>
or
using the automatically defined
<CODE>__EMX__</code>
variable set by EMX itself.  I find
the OS2 variable to be the most intuitive when reading the code later.
Once you have everything done why not share your results with others.
Often the original author is more than happy to incorporate your changes
into the original source and with your help, and perhaps a post to Hobbes'
incoming directory, another great OS/2 program will be available for
everyone to use. it is then displayed on the output window.

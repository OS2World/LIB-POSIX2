<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Contrary to popular belief, high resolution timing is quite possible under
OS/2.  There are services to query the current time with microsecond
accuracy and to receive events with millisecond accuracy.  This article
will discuss all of the timing mechanisms available for OS/2.

<H2>Background: Ring 3 and Ring 0 - User vs. Supervisor mode</H2>

<P>OS/2 is a protected operating system.  One of the features of a protected
OS is that a given program lives in a particular level of protection, or
privilege.  The microprocessor defines the number of privilege levels and
the differences between them, and they are ranked from least privileged to
most privileged.

<P>Early processors, like the 8086, only had one level.  Most modern
processors allow two levels, typically called supervisor mode and user
mode. The 80x86 line, however, allows four levels, or "rings" as Intel
calls them.  Ring 0 is the most privileged and Ring 3 the least.  OS/2
assigns Ring 0 to supervisor mode and Ring 3 to user mode.  Ring 2 is used
as a sort of "privileged user mode," but for the purpose of this article,
it can be treated like Ring 3.  Ring 1 is not used by OS/2.

<P>Therefore, a particular piece of OS/2 code runs in either Ring 0 or
Ring 3.  For example, most device drivers and the OS/2 kernel run in Ring
0, and all applications run in Ring 3.  The rules for program execution
vary greatly between the two rings.

<P>The primary difference between the two rings is in the type of
instructions that code in a particular ring is allowed to execute.  This
is why these rings are also called "privilege levels" - code running in
Ring 0 is more privileged than code in Ring 3, and can therefore execute
more types of instructions.  For example, Ring 0 code, which usually
exists in the form of a physical device driver (PDD), can perform I/O
instructions, can receive hardware interrupts, and can get access to all
of the system memory.  However, PDD's are more difficult to write and
debug, so the idea is to avoid them if possible.

<P>The second difference between Ring 0 and Ring 3 is the scheduling
mechanism.  Scheduling is the process of  transfering control from one
program to another, and the scheduling mechanism determines how and when
such a transfer, a.k.a. task switch, occurs.  As you know, OS/2 is a
pre-emptive multithreaded operating system, but this only applies to Ring
3.  Ring 0 has a completely different scheduling mechanism.

<H2>Processes: What are they, really?</H2>

<P>The word "program" is very nebulous and abstract term.  We all understand
what a program is, but it's a difficult concept to describe in words, so I
am not going to try.  "Process" is sometimes used synonymously with
"program", but a process is really more specific, in that it describes one
aspect of a program.  In short, a process refers to the fact that when a
program runs in OS/2, the memory (RAM) it occupies is protected from other
processes.  That is, without special provisions, one process cannot affect
another process, either by accessing its memory, modifying its threads,
and so on.  A program, in its most vague definition, can actually consist
of multiple processes, but typically it's a one-to-one ratio.  They key
point is that whatever program or part of a program is located in a
process, that code is separate from other processes.

<H2>Threads: Not quite virtual CPUs</H2>

<P>A thread is defined as "a separate and almost simulataneous section of
executing code."  This definition, unfortunately, doesn't describe what a
thread really is.  Threads are an abstraction - they simulate having an
infinite number of microprocessors working in parallel.  In a sense, each
thread is a "virtual CPU".  The idea is to take a portion of your program
that does one specific task and create a thread for it.  Then one virtual
CPU will perform this task while the other virtual CPUs work on other
tasks.  With an infinite number of CPUs, each thread can run at 100% all
the time.

<P>Unfortunately, this model does not fit reality.  In practice, most
computers have only one CPU, and those that have more still have far fewer
CPUs than threads.  In situations when there are more threads than CPUs
(i.e. all the time), the threads must share the CPUs.  This sharing is
performed by having the CPU switch from thread to thread.  After a thread
is given a chance to run, typically for a few milliseconds, it is "put to
sleep," and then the next thread, which was previously asleep, is given a
chance to run also for a few milliseconds.  This duration of time when a
thread runs is called a timeslice, and the switching from one thread to
another is called a task switch.

<P>The fact that the CPU must switch from thread to thread alters the
model of an infinite number of virtual CPUs.  If each thread really did
have its own CPU, then a thread would most likely enter an idle loop when
it needs to wait for an event.  If all threads had to share the same CPU,
then this thread would eat up its entire timeslice doing nothing.  In
other words, although threads attempt to provide the concept of an
infinite number of virtual threads, in reality the programmer must design
his threads knowing how many real CPUs there are.  And the rules change if
you have one or more than one CPU.

<H4>Only one CPU</H4>

<P>With only one CPU, there is no true parallelism among the threads.  That
is, you will never have two threads executing at the same time, so it
makes no sense to divide a computationally intensive task into multiple
threads, because it will not complete any faster.  In fact, it will take
longer because you now incur the overhead of task switches.  The purpose
of threads now becomes to make more efficient use of the CPU.  The less
CPU your application needs, the faster it runs and the more CPU remains
for other applications.  For this case, the use of threads falls into two
categories:

<OL>

<LI>Background tasks.  Any time-consuming operation (e.g. saving a file)
can be performed by a separate thread, thereby freeing the primary thread
(e.g. the one that processes user input) and allowing it to be more
responsive.

<LI>Handling a mix of I/O and computation.  Some programs need to read
data from one or more inputs, process it, and then send to one or more
outputs.  By putting each input, output, and compute task in their own
threads, you can use OS/2's built-in scheduling mechanism to insure that
when data is available, it is processed as soon as possible.

</OL>

Determining how to multithread your application is beyond the scope of
this article, mainly because there are few hard rules that can be used for
every application.  The list of  references includes books and articles
that talk about how best to implement multithreading your software.

<H4>More than one CPU</H4>

<P>It's difficult to find software that could take advantage of multiple
CPUs, let alone software that actually is optimized for multiple CPUs.  In
most cases, if your app is heavily multithreaded, it will run just as
well, and maybe better, on multiple CPUs.  In most cases, however, the
other CPUs will be used for any other programs or for the operating system
itself.  Although your app may not run better, the system as a whole runs
better.  For example, DOS sessions can be configured to use two threads,
and it has been reported that on Warp Server SMP with two CPUs, Windows
MIDI applications run flawlessly.

<P>A computer which has more than one CPU, where all CPUs are identical
and operate in parallel, is called a Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP)
machine.  Techniques for optimizing your code for SMP are beyond the scope
of this article.  For more information, check out EDM/2 issues <A
HREF="../0507/index.html">5-7</A> and <A
HREF="../0509/index.html">5-9</A>.

<H2>Thread states and classes</H2>

<P>A typical system has dozens, maybe hundreds of threads at any given time.
Since there is only one CPU for all these threads, something must keep
track of threads so the CPU knows where to go during a task switch.  This
something is called the task scheduler, or just scheduler.  In order to
determine which threads are next in line, the scheduler applies two
attributes to each thread: state and priority.

<P>Threads have three states: running, ready, and blocked.  A running
thread is one that is currently running, so obviously the the number of
running threads in the system is less than or equal to the number of CPUs.
A ready thread is one that is waiting to run, i.e. the ready state occurs
right before the running state.  When a task switch occurs, the scheduler
looks only at the list of ready threads to determine which one is next.  A
blocked thread is one that has been put to sleep, either because it or
some other thread forced it to sleep, or because it is waiting for an I/O
operation to complete.  Once the thread is "woken up", it is moved to the
ready state.

<P>A thread has any one of four priority classes: idle (I), regular (R),
foreground server or fixed high (S), and time-critical (TC), and within
each class there is a level or delta, which ranges from 0 to 31.  For
example, a time-critical thread with a +5 delta would be written as TC+5.
Deltas are used to specify a relative difference between two threads in a
particular class.  For instance, if you have two time-critical threads A
and B, and if you want to ensure that A always runs first whenever both A
and B are in the ready state, you would make A's priority TC+1 and B's
priority TC+0.

<P>The delta is also used by OS/2 to dynamically modify a thread's
priority.  A thread is never boosted to the next class, and only threads
in the regular class are modified by the system.  Reasons why a thread
would be boosted include:

<UL>

<LI>The thread belongs to the foreground process

<LI>The thread has been in the ready state longer than other threads

<LI>The thread has been blocked on an I/O operation which was just
    completed

</UL>

The default priority for a thread is R+0, and it can be adjusted to other
priorities via the DosSetPriority API. The idle class is used for a thread
that should only run when there is nothing else running in the system.
This priority is usually reserved for non-essential threads, such as one
that would be used for a utility that monitors the swapper file.  A
foreground server thread is exactly like a normal thread, except that its
priority is not lowered when it is placed in the background.  Thus, a
foreground server thread has the same priority profile regardless of
whether the process is in the foreground or background.  This behavior is
necessary for certain network server applications, hence the name.

<P>The idle and foreground server priority classes are not important in
the context of this article.  The time-critical class, however, is very
important.  It behaves radically different from the other classes, and
these differences are the basis for some of the techniques discussed in
this article.  Time-critical threads are covered in detail below.

<P>A process has at least one thread.  Any process or program which has
more than one thread is said to be multithreaded.

<H2>Thread Scheduling in Ring 3</H2>

<P>The OS/2 scheduler, which controls the thread switching, has three
characteristics:

<OL>

<LI>When it comes time to transfer control to another thread, the
scheduler uses a priority-based mechanism to decide what that next thread
is.  Each thread has the option of changing its priority, and this affects
the ordering of threads.  Threads of higher priority run before threads of
lower priority.  All threads of the same priority are run in round-robin
fashion; that is, in sequence.  Only threads that are in the "ready" state
are considered, as these are the only ones that are waiting to run.

<LI>In order to provide a robust multithreading environment, the scheduler
can pre-empt (yank control from) a currently running thread if its
time-slice has expired.  A time-slice is usually 32 milliseconds.  Not
only does this prevent a thread from blocking other threads, but it also
allows the developer to create a CPU-intensive thread without worrying
about degrading overall system performance.

<LI>Task switches can only occur when the scheduler is activated, and the
scheduler is only activated in response to an external event.  Such events
include hardware timer interrupts, interrupts from other devices such as
disk drives or serial ports, and calls to certain OS/2 API's.

</OL>

The biggest misconception of OS/2 scheduling is that function #2 is the
most important factor.  When people learn about OS/2's 32ms time slices,
they believe that all threads cycle in 32ms slices, and that a thread will
usually have to wait at least that long before it gets an event
notification.  This is not true at all.  Function #1 is the most
important, because if you can get the scheduler to run your thread
whenever you need it to, you will have pseudo real-time performance.  I
say "pseudo" because there is significant overhead in switching from the
current thread to your thread, possibly as long as several milliseconds,
but at least it is nowhere near as bad as Windows 95.

<P>Consider three threads, T1, T2, and T3.  T1's priority is R+3, and both
T2 and T3 are R+0.  When the scheduler is activated, it must look at all
of the threads in the ready state and decide which one is to be run.
Let's consider all possible combinations of T1, T2, and T3 being in the
ready state, and there are no other threads in the system.  Let's also
ignore the case where none of them are in the "ready" state.

<PRE><SMALL>
     T1 ready?  T2 ready?  T3 ready?  Next to run?
        N          N          Y           T3
        N          Y          N           T2
        N          Y          Y           T2 or T3
        Y          N          N           T1
        Y          N          Y           T1
        Y          Y          N           T1
        Y          Y          Y           T1
</SMALL></PRE>

As you can see, since T1 is of higher priority, it always runs if it's
ready.  And as for the case when T2 and T3 (but not T1) are ready, T2 will
run if T3 was the last R+0 thread to run, and T3 will run if T2 was the
last R+0 thread to run.  In other words, all threads of the same priority
are group together, in sequential order, and after a thread runs, it is
moved to the end of the sequence.

<P>Methods for synchronizing threads (e.g. by using semaphores) and
communicating between threads (e.g. via pipes or shared memory) are beyond
the scope of this article.

<H2>Regular threads - 32ms time slices</H2>

<P>As you probably know, normal OS/2 threads run in 32ms time slices.  But
what does this mean, exactly?  For starters, it means that a normal thread
will run for no more than 32ms before it gets pre-empted.  However, few
threads actually run this long.  After all, a 90MHz Pentium can easily
execute two million instructions in 32 milliseconds.  A thread will
usually block for some other reason first, such as calling an OS/2 API.

<P>Regular threads, as their name implies, are not very interesting.
Because of they don't have any real-time capability, few of the advanced
timing functions work correctly.

<H2>Time critical threads - 8ms time slices</H2>

<P>Time critical threads are more than just threads that run at a higher
priority.  Their entire scheduling model is different in two ways:

<OL>

<LI>The timeslices are only 8ms long.  This means that if there are two TC
threads with the same priority delta and doing nothing but computations,
the CPU will switch back-and-forth between them every 8ms.

<LI>If a TC thread moves into the ready state, and its priority delta is
higher than any other TC thread that is currently running, that new TC
thread will immediately pre-empt the current TC thread.  This means that
the only thing which can pre-empt a TC+31 thread is a hardware interrupt.

</OL>

The system clock driver, CLOCK01.SYS, is responsible for programming the
timer hardware to generate the interrupts necessary to signal the end of a
timeslice.  With OS/2 Warp 3 GA (no fixpacks) and earlier, the clock
driver would dynamically switch between 32Hz (31.25ms) and 128Hz (8.025ms)
whenever necessary.  On some systems with flaky timer hardware this
switching caused inaccuracies in the clock, so now the clock stays at
128Hz, even when there are no TC threads.  Unfortunately, there is no way
to access this new higher frequency clock.  None of the APIs has changed.

<H2>OS/2 API Services for Ring 3 Timing</H2>

<DL>

<DT>DosSleep

<DD>
<PRE><SMALL>
  #define INCL_DOSPROCESS
  #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

  ULONG     msec;  /*  The time, in milliseconds, for which the calling
                       thread's execution will be suspended. */
  APIRET    ulrc;  /*  Return Code. */

  ulrc = DosSleep(msec);
</SMALL></PRE>

This API puts the current thread to sleep for a specified amount of time.
In other words, it moves itself from the running state to the blocked
state.  The thread remains in the blocked state for the duration specified
in the DosSleep call, and then it moves to the ready state.  The time
interval is specified in milliseconds, although the granularity of
DosSleep is the same as the length of a timeslice - 32ms.

<P>There is one special case to this API.  DosSleep(0) will cause the
thread to yield the remainder of its timeslice to another thread in the
ready state with a higher priority.  Obviously calling DosSleep(0) in a TC
thread has no value because higher-priority TC threads already pre-empt
lower-priority ones as soon as they move into the ready state.

<P><DT>DosAsynchTimer, DosStartTimer, and DosStopTimer

  HSEM   hsem;    /*  The handle of an event semaphore that will
                      be posted when the time specified by msec

  HTIMER htimer;  /*  The timer handle. */

  ulrc = DosAsyncTimer(msec, hsem, &amp;htimer);
</SMALL></PRE>

 and

<PRE><SMALL>
  #define INCL_DOSDATETIME
  #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

  ULONG  msec;    /*  The time, in milliseconds, that will elapse
                      between postings of the event semaphore
                      specified by hsem. */
  HSEM   hsem;    /*  The handle of the event semaphore that is
                      posted each time msec elapses. */
  HTIMER htimer;  /*  The timer handle. */
  APIRET ulrc;    /*  Return Code. */

  ulrc = DosStartTimer(msec, hsem, &amp;htimer);
</SMALL></PRE>

and

<PRE><SMALL>
  #define INCL_DOSDATETIME
  #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

  HTIMER    htimer;  /*  The handle of the timer to stop. */
  APIRET    ulrc;    /*  Return Code. */

  ulrc = DosStopTimer(htimer);
</SMALL></PRE>

These three APIs are used to create an asynchronous timer.  The parameters
are a time interval and a semaphore handle.  The call returns immediately,
and after the time interval has passed, the system will posts the
semaphore.  The difference between the two APIs is that DosAsynchTimer is
a one-shot timer whereas DosStartTime is periodic.  DosStopTimer can be
used to stop both types of timers.

<P><DT>WinStartTimer and WinStopTimer

  #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

  HAB      hab;             /*  Anchor-block handle. */
  HWND     hwnd;            /*  Window handle that is part of the
                                timer identification. */
  ULONG    ulTimer;         /*  Timer identifier. */
  ULONG    ulTimeout;       /*  Delay time in milliseconds. */
  ULONG    ulTimerStarted;  /*  Timer identity. */

  ulTimerStarted = WinStartTimer(hab, hwnd, ulTimer, ulTimeout);
</SMALL></PRE>

and

<PRE><SMALL>
  #define INCL_WINTIMER /* Or use INCL_WIN, INCL_PM, */
  #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

  HAB      hab;      /*  Anchor-block handle. */
  HWND     hwnd;     /*  Window handle. */
  ULONG    ulTimer;  /*  Timer identifier. */
  BOOL     rc;       /*  Success indicator. */

  rc = WinStopTimer(hab, hwnd, ulTimer);
</SMALL></PRE>

WinStartTimer is the Presentation Manager (PM) version of DosStartTimer.
Instead of posting a semaphore, a WM_TIMER message is sent to the a
message queue.  Since it's possible to have a time-critical thread blocked
on the semaphore for DosStartTimer, and since WM_TIMER is just a PM
message, chances are DosStartTimer will be more accurate.  As expected,
WinStopTimer can be used to cancel the timer.

<P><DT>DosTmrQueryFreq and DosTmrQueryTime

<DD>
<PRE><SMALL>
  #define INCL_DOSPROFILE
  #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

  PULONG pulTmrFreq;  /*  A pointer to the frequency of the counter. */
  APIRET ulrc;        /*  Return Code. */

  ulrc = DosTmrQueryFreq(pulTmrFreq);

  APIRET ulrc;      /*  Return Code. */

  ulrc = DosTmrQueryTime(PQWORD pqwTmrTime)
</SMALL></PRE>

These two undocumented functions use the 8253/4 timer chip to obtain a
timestamp.  DosTmrQueryTime returns the current count, and DosTmrQueryFreq
returns the frequency at which the counter increments.  This frequency is
about 1.1MHz, which gives you a timer that's accurate to the microsecond -
the most accurate of all timing functions in OS/2.

<P><DT>DosGetDateTime and DosSetDateTime

<DD>
<PRE><SMALL>
  #define INCL_DOSDATETIME
  #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

  DATETIME  dt;    /*  DateTime data structure. */
  APIRET    ulrc;  /*  Return Code. */

  ulrc = DosGetDateTime(&amp;dt);

  DATETIME  dt;    /*  DateTime data structure. */
  APIRET    ulrc;  /*  Return Code. */

  ulrc = DosSetDateTime(&amp;dt);
</SMALL></PRE>

DosGetDateTime obtains the current date, including day of the week, and
time, including the current timezone.  The returned time supports values
to the 100th of a second; however, it is not really that accurate.
DosSetDateTime, as you can imagine, sets the current date and time in the
CMOS.  Since every field of the DATETIME structure is used to update the
CMOS, it is easiest to first use DosGetDateTime to fill the DATETIME
structure, change whichever values you want to change, and then call
DosSetDateTime.

<P><DT>DosGetInfoSeg

<DD>Like most functions that have the word "Seg" in them, this is a 16-bit
API.  In theory, it should be usable from 32-bit code, but many
programmers have problems getting the old 16-bit API's to work, especially
if DLL's are involved.  If your toolkit does not have this function
listed, you can try the Build Environment on the DDK (<A
HREF="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/ddk/">
http://service.boulder.ibm.com/ddk/</A>).

<P>The function returns two selectors, from which you can generate two
16-bit far pointers.  The first points to a InfoSegGDT structure, and the
second points to a InfoSegLDT structure.  Both structures are defined in
infoseg.h.  InfoSegGDT is very much like the structure returned from the
DevHelp_GetDOSVar, subfunction DHGETDOSV_SYSINFOSEG call for device
drivers (see below).  The structure contains various time and date
information, including a running millisecond counter.

<P><DT>RDTSC Assembly Language Instruction (Pentium and higher only)

<DD>
<PRE><SMALL>
  0F 31  RDTSC    ; Result -> EDX:EAX == 64-bit current cycle count
</SMALL></PRE>

The RDTSC assembly-language instruction, available only on the Pentium and
higher, is not an OS/2-specific service, but it is included here for
completeness.  After executing this instruction, the EDX:EAX pair contains
a 64-bit count of the total machine cycles since the processor was reset.
This instruction can be executed in Ring 3 or in Ring 0; however, it
cannot be used to accurately time a sequence of code in Ring 3 because
there is no way to suspend or even detect when a task switch has occured,
so the result is not dependable.

<P><DT>TIMER0, The high resolution timer driver - the last resort

<DD>The TIMER0.SYS device driver that comes with Warp 4 provides 1
millisecond timing services for applications (Ring 3) and device drivers
(Ring 0).  TIMER0, unfortunately, has some serious drawbacks, and
therefore should be considered a last resort.

<P>This warning cannot be stressed enough.  TIMER0, when active, will
disable almost every DOS application, including Win-OS/2 itself, and
therefore every Windows application.  TIMER0 generates 1,000 interrupts
per second, and therefore can easily overload the system, especially on
slower machines.  TIMER0 also uses the same hardware as most performance
analyzers, so these tools cannot be used.  Applications and drivers which
use TIMER0 services are called clients, and TIMER0 allows far more
simultaneous clients than it can actually handle.

<P>With all of these limitations, TIMER0 should only be used if there is
no other way to perform the required task.  In addition, if there is an
alternative method that can provide acceptable timing accuracy in at least
some cases, that method must be available as an option.

<P>TIMER0 can be accessed via an IOCtl interface, which provides the
ability to:

<OL>

<LI>Obtain a pointer to the clock counter.  The pointer returned is a
16:16 pointer, which should be converted to a 0:32 pointer for use with
32-bit applications. This pointer allows you to obtain the current
timestamp without the overhead of an API call.

<LI>Query and set the resolution. Currently, the resolution is always 1
millisecond.  Attempts to set it to another value will be ignored, and
querying the driver will always return 1 millisecond. You should set the
resolution anyway-in the future, the driver may actually use a lower
resolution to conserve resources.

<LI>Block until a certain time has elapsed.  This function must be called
from a time-critical thread, otherwise it will be no more more accurate
than DosSleep.  In addition, the overhead of calling this function can add
as much as 2ms.

</OL>
</DL>

DDK.

<H2>Scheduling in Ring 0</H2>

<P>Whereas the scheduler in Ring 3 is pre-emptive, the Ring 0 scheduler is
co-operative.  Actually, the Ring 0 and Ring 3 schedulers are the same
scheduler, the difference is that when a thread is running in Ring 0, the
only thing that can pre-empt it is a hardware interrupt.  And when the
interrupt handler is finished, control returns back to the Ring 0 thread.
There are no timeslices in Ring 0.

<P>Threads in Ring 0 also have priorities and states, although thread
priorities don't play as significant a role as they do in Ring 3, because
usually there are far fewer threads in Ring 0 and they run infrequently
and for only a short time.  However, Ring 0 threads do have an addition
attiribute: the context, or mode.  The thread context limits what API's
are available to the thread.  The context is determined by how the thread
was created, and therefore a thread cannot change its context.  There are
three contexts:

<OL>

<LI>Init Mode: An driver runs in init mode when the device driver is first
loaded and OS/2 calls its initialization function.  One feature of init
mode is that the initialization function actually runs in Ring 3, so the
driver can make some DosXxxx calls, such as opening a file or calling
another driver.  It can also perform I/O operations and call some DevHelp
(device driver API) services, therefore it is not like normal Ring 3
threads.

<LI>Interrupt Mode.  Interrupt mode is reserved exclusively for the
driver's interrupt handler.  This mode is the most restrictive, in that
only a small subset of DevHelp functions can be called.

<LI>Kernel Mode. Kernel mode is the most common context in which a driver
runs.  Examples include when a driver gets called via  DosXxx function,
like DosOpen or DosDevIOCtl, or when a driver is called via a context
hook.

</OL>

<H2>Device Driver Interrupt Threads</H2>

<P>An interrupt thread is a device driver thread that runs in interrupt mode.
In other words, it is the thread that runs an interrupt handler.
Interrupt threads are the highest-priority threads in OS/2.

<P>Interrupt handlers are functions that handle hardware interrupts -
signals that come from devices, such as a hard drive or a modem, which
indicate that the device needs attention from software.  Typically this
means that the device has data that it needs to send to a program, but it
could also mean that the device is ready to accept data or that it has
important status information.

<P>The PC architecture supports 16 different hardware interrupt levels, or
IRQs, and these levels constitute different priorities.  This means that
when an interrupt at a certain level is being serviced (i.e. the interrupt
handler for that IRQ is currently running), it can be pre-empted by an
interrupt of a higher priority.  Interrupts at a lower priority are
automatically delayed until the current interrupt handler exits.  However,
it is possible for an interrupt handler to disable all interrups with the
cli assembly instruction, but SMP-aware drivers should use
DevHelp_AcquireSpinLock API instead.  In fact, a device driver can disable
interrupts via cli or DevHelp_AcquireSpinLock from any context, not just
from an interrupt handler.

<H2>Device Driver Context Hooks</H2>

<P>Context hooks allow an interrupt handler to be processed in kernel mode.
Before the interrupt handler is called, a context hook is allocated via
DevHelp_AllocateCtxHook.  A context hook is basically a device driver
thread that runs in kernel mode.  When the interrupt handler is called, it
performs the bare minimum processing, such as fetching the data from the
device and placing it into a queue, and then it arms the context hook via
DevHelp_ArmCtxHook.  Immediately after the interrupt handler exits,
provided there isn't another interrupt pending, the context hook runs.

<P>By using context hooks, there are three advantages.  First, you can
call more DevHelp services than you can in an interrupt handler.  Second,
moving time-consuming code from the interrupt handler to a context hook is
more system-friendly, since interrupts are not disabled.  Third, since the
interrupt handler is much shorter, it might be possible to disable
interrupts throughout the entire handler, removing the need for
nested-interrupt logic in the code, thereby simplifying the programming.

<H2>DevHelp_Yield and DevHelp_TCYield</H2>

<PRE><SMALL>
  USHORT usrc;     /*  Return Code. */

  usrc = DevHelp_Yield();
</SMALL></PRE>

DevHelp_Yield will yield the CPU to any higher priority thread.  Every 3
milliseconds (as recommended by the online documentation), a driver should
call DevHelp_GetDosVar subfunction DHGETDOSV_YIELDFLAG to see if there is
a kernel thread in the ready state.  If so, DevHelp_Yield should be
called.  DevHelp_TCYield is a special case of DevHelp_Yield, in that it
will only yield the CPU to a time-critical thread.  DevHelp_Yield is a
superset of DevHelp_TCYield, so there is no need to call both.

<H2>DevHelp_SetTimer and DevHelp_TickCount - 32ms callbacks</H2>

<PRE><SMALL>
  USHORT     usrc;                /*  Return Code. */
  void NEAR  TimerHandler(void);  /* Callback function */

  usrc = DevHelp_SetTimer((NPFN) TimerHandler )
</SMALL></PRE>

and

<PRE><SMALL>
  USHORT usrc;                    /*  Return Code. */
  USHORT TickCount;               /* Number of ticks per call */
  void NEAR TimerHandler(void);   /* Callback function */

  usrc = DevHelp_TickCount((NPFN) TimerHandler, TickCount );
</SMALL></PRE>

DevHelp_SetTimer is used to provide callbacks to the driver.  A pointer to
a function is passed, and every timer tick (32ms) thereafter, the kernel
will call that function on an interrupt thread.  DevHelp_TickCount does
the same thing, but you have to option of specifying every n timer ticks.

<H2>DevHelp_GetDOSVar, subfunction DHGETDOSV_SYSINFOSEG</H2>

<PRE><SMALL>
  USHORT usrc;                    /* Return Code. */
  USHORT TickCount;               /* Number of ticks per call */
  void NEAR TimerHandler(void);   /* Callback function */
  PGINFOSEG pGlobalInfoSeg;       /* Pointer to Global Info Seg

  usrc = DevHelp_GetDOSVar(DHGETDOSV_SYSINFOSEG, 0, &pGlobalInfoSeg);
</SMALL></PRE>

This function returns a pointer to a GINFOSEG structure (see bsedos16.h)
which contains, among other things, several fields of time and date
information, much like the DosGetDateTime API.

<H2>TIMER0, The high resolution timer driver - the last resort</H2>

<P>Again, it must be stressed that use of TIMER0 should be considered as a
last resort.

<P>Besides the IOCtl interface, TIMER0 also includes a device driver
interface via Inter-Device Communication, or IDC.  Two services are
provided:

<OL>

<LI>Callback every n milliseconds, where n is an integer >= 1. This first
option allows your device driver to register itself with the
high-resolution timer. The device driver provides a 16:16 address of a
function that the high-resolution timer calls every n milliseconds.
Registration (and deregistration) cannot occur during interrupt time.   If
a device driver re-registers itself-by calling the registration function
with the same 16:16 pointer-the high-resolution timer simply changes the
count. This can occur at interrupt time.

<LI>Query the current time.  This second option is used to obtain a 16:16
pointer to the current count variable. This variable can then be read by
the device driver to obtain the current time. Note that this variable is
only updated if the high-resolution timer is active-which is only true if
at least one driver or application has registered itself with the
high-resolution timer. Also note that this variable can be synchronized to
another timeclock.

</OL>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>Given the large selection of timing services and the improved performance
over Windows 95 and Windows NT, OS/2 Warp 4 makes a great platform for
timing-sensitive applications, including those that need near real-time
responsiveness.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Well, I have a little bit of a bad feeling.  What I am going to describe in
this article is something that should not be possible at the level of user
application programs:  direct I/O.	This is the ability of a user program
to talk to hardware resources directly, not controlled or even monitored by
the operating system.

<P>Although it might have been common practice in a simple program loader like
DOS, it is normally not a good idea in a modern multitasking or multi-user
system.  In fact, OS/2, Windows NT, and the various UNIX derived operating
systems, spend considerable efforts to hide this practice from user
applications, or explicitly prohibit it. The reasons for that are obvious
and well known:

<UL>
<LI>User programs could access system resources, that means here hardware
devices, in an uncoordinated or uncooperative way, and could therefore
severely influence or even damage data integrity, system stability, and
security.
<LI>While the operating system tries to distribute the limited resources in a
fair way among the various competitors, a program that circumvents the care
of the operating system, could grab such a resource exclusively.	Even
worse, it might struggle with the operating system for control, which will
unlikely have good consequences on the overall system throughput.
<LI>Needless to say, a malign process like a computer virus could use a
feature like direct I/O to intentionally destroy data.  However, even with
good intention, a user program is not immune against software bugs that
might not only crash the program itself but also take the system with it
into the abyss.
</UL>

On the other hand, people usually do not want to have I/O access to write
improved support for complicated disk or video devices.  Rather they have
simple I/O devices like data acquisition cards, parallel I/O boards, EPROM
programmer adapters or alike, that do not come with OS/2 support at all.

<P>Writing a full-blown OS/2 device driver in order to reuse an old 8255 port
card seems like shooting sparrows with cannons.  In such a case, where
neither interrupt handling or DMA, nor physical access to adapter memory is
involved, direct I/O appears to be a feasible alternative.	In the
following chapter, we will look at the official methods that OS/2 offers to
do I/O.

<H2>Doing Port I/O: The Front Doors</H2>

<H4>Device drivers</H4>

<P>No doubt, as was already stated, a device driver is the real solution. Keep
critical tasks away from the user is the rule of the game.	The path to
this is quite stony, however.

<P>As often criticized, device drivers in OS/2 are still 16 bit code.  This
has several disadvantages.

<UL>
<LI>You need to code entirely in assembler, or find a C compiler that still
produces 16 bit code.  Most of the standard drivers that come with OS/2
were built with either MASM 5.1 or MSC 6.0.  It is not only the problem
that IBM relies on products of a competitor here, but simply that these
products are no longer available in stores, and the successors no longer
support OS/2. Fortunately, the recent, widely available Watcom 10.0
compiler is usable for device driver development.
<LI>Coding in 16 bit throws the developer back into the stone age where he
has to fight against 64K segments, far and near calls, moving around
selectors and grouping segments in a certain order.
</UL>

Nevertheless, one could think about writing a device driver that you can
use to read and write I/O ports by issuing special DosDevIOCtl
instructions. Surprisingly, this is an unnecessary enterprise!  Not many
OS/2 users know that every stock OS/2 system comes with a device driver
that comes with such a functionality:  TESTCFG.SYS.

<P>Besides some other functions that are beyond the scope of this article,
TESTCFG.SYS  offers two ioctls, one for reading I/O ports and another one
for writing.  See table 1 for the description of the functions and the
simple program fragment in figure 1 for an example.

</SMALL>

<P>There is one drawback, and we will hear this argument again real soon:	it
is slow.  Why?

<P>Now see, we are calling this function from a 32 bit user program.  The
DosDevIOCtl() will enter the kernel through a call gate which is some kind
of a protected door.  The kernel will then first check the validity of the
parameter and data packets, identify the target driver to perform this
function, and then call the appropriate driver entry point.  Note the
driver is 16 bit code, so the kernel must convert the addresses of the
parameter and data packets from 0:32 bit user space addresses to 16:16 bit
device driver addresses.  Finally, the driver itself must decode the
command and dispatch it to its routines.

<P>I once tried to trace such an ioctl call with the kernel debugger, and
eventually gave up counting after following some hundred instructions
without seeing any driver code.  Compare this with a single IN or OUT
instruction. That's bureaucracy!

<H4>IOPL Segments</H4>

<P>The second method is actually a leftover from earlier OS/2 1.X versions,
hence it is a 16 bit technique as well.

<P>Let me elaborate here a bit on the method used to prevent I/O access by
user programs.  The Intel 286 and later (386, 486, Pentium) processors can
execute code at four different privilege levels.  Because they are nested
and usually drawn as concentric circles, these levels are frequently
referred to as privilege rings (or protection rings).  Ring 0 is the level
with the highest privilege, and ring 3 has the lowest privilege (see figure
2).

<P><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="32bit1.gif" HEIGHT=230 WIDTH=377>
</CENTER>

<SMALL>Figure 2: The privilege rings and their use in OS/2</SMALL>

<P>If a process wants to run with a higher privilege than the one it currently
has, it must go through a special gate; one might also compare a gate with
a tunnel or &quot;wormhole&quot;.  There are several types of gates such as
interrupt, trap, or task gates.  The only interesting type for us is the
call gate.	A call gate allows a one-way transfer of execution from a
segment with some privilege to another one with same or higher privilege.
The other direction, that is from a &quot;trustworthy&quot; high-privileged code
segment to a less trusted lower-privileged segment, is not possible.  See
figure 2.

</CENTER>

<SMALL>Figure 3: Allowed and forbidden transactions with call gates</SMALL>

<P>Two bits in the processor status register (the IOPL field) determine the
level that is necessary to execute I/O CPU instructions.  Any code with
less than this privilege level will trigger an exception at the first
attempt to execute such an instruction.  Table 2 lists the affected
instructions. Certain instructions will even cause an exception if the
process has the privilege to I/O.  These instructions require ring 0
privilege.	Table 2 also lists these instructions (386 processor).

<P>Table 2: Privileged Instructions
</SMALL>

<P>In OS/2, the required privilege level for I/O is ring 2 or better, and
tough luck, any user process only runs in ring 3 (figure 2).

<P>In order to get a controlled way to do I/O, the OS/2 developers provided a
method to execute 16 bit code at ring 2 level.	When the linker produces an
executable from several object files, it accepts a special attribute for
code segments under certain circumstances.  This attribute is named IOPL
and is specified in the segment declaration section of a linker definition
file (Consult appropriate linker documentation).  The linker then annotates
the code in a way that every call of a routine in this IOPL segment will be
directed through a call gate, rather than a simple call.  When such a
program is loaded into memory for execution, the loader code in the kernel
will generate a R3-&gt;R2 call gate for each target called in an IOPL segment
(see call gate X in figure 3).

<P>Each time such a call gate is entered, the processor will gain ring 2
privilege and lose it again when leaving by a normal return instruction.

<P>Apparently, this looked like a feature which could be abused, so the IBM
developers restricted it in a way that only segments in a DLL can get the
IOPL attribute.  This appears to be a built-in feature of the program
loader, not just the linker, as patching the appropriate tables in the
executable will not work.

<P>This restriction is not a bad idea, as it is now no longer possible to make
an executable disguising as a normal program, but doing I/O inside.  There
must be an accompanying DLL, to arouse suspicion - or at least should do
so.

<P>This could have been an almost ideal way for moderate I/O - if IBM had
provided a similar method for 32 bit applications as well.	There is no
restriction in the processor itself concerning 32 bit I/O, as one might
suspect; it is an intentional limitation.  Since IBM will not support 16
bit software any longer in OS/2 for the PowerPC, those unsecure interfaces
will disappear in the future.

<P>Nevertheless, you can call routines in such a 16 bit IOPL DLL from a 32 bit
executable, and there are several example files floating around in various
FTP archives.  The key item here is thunking.  The main problem with
calling code of another size gender is that the program counter as well as
the stack pointer needs to be adjusted to the corresponding other size.  If
address parameters are passed through the stack, these addresses need to be
converted as well.  This is what a thunking routine does.

<P>Usually the compiler generates such routines automatically when a 16 bit
routine is declared, and this is why many high- level programmers do not
encounter them at all.	However, even if they seem to be invisible, they
nevertheless contribute a considerable share to performance degradation if
an I/O routine in the IOPL DLL is called from a 32 bit application.

<H2>Doing I/O: Searching for Mouse Holes</H2>

<P>In the last section, we have seen that it is possible to do direct I/O with
the already available facilities.  The difficulty is just the excessive
overhead that makes their use quite unattractive, and with the text of the
preface still in mind, there can be no doubt that this is not incidental.

<P>However, as some of you might know about my ambitious pet project, it was
indispensable for me to find an extremely fast alternative to the above
stuff. Although I prefer writing a device driver for that kind of
applications, it seemed entirely impossible to put a complete Xserver into
a 16 bit device driver (that beast, with PEX, is as large as 2 MB - 32 bit
code!).  Moving only the critical parts into a driver might work;
unfortunately the XFree86 people are too creative for me, so it would be
expectable that I'd be hurrying to get their recent changes integrated for
the rest of my life.

<P>So let us discuss possible alternatives.

<H4>Outwitting the Program Loader?</H4>

<P>As we have seen in the discussion of the IOPL mechanism, the bottleneck is
the thunking code.  Interestingly, there exist types of call gates that can
mediate among 32 and 16 bit code and do the necessary conversion of the
program counter and stack pointer automatically.  Unfortunately, the
program loader refuses to make them for us.  Likewise, there seems to be no
chance to have it create a 32->32 bit call gate.  A brute force approach
could be trying to identify the call gates it made for us and redirect them
to the routines that we want to run with privilege.  Since we need certain
instructions to manipulate the GDT or LDT (more on that later), this is not
possible from a user program, because the kernel protects these structures
well in a ring 0 segment.  Similar to the restriction not to pass a call
gate in the wrong direction, a process cannot read, let alone write, data
of a higher ring level.  This is not a real problem, if we have an
accomplice with sufficient rights to do the dirty work for us:  a device
driver.

<P>However, besides being a bad hack, such a solution is still half-hearted.
Once we find a method to manipulate call gates, we no longer need to have
this code separated in a DLL, as with the IOPL anachronism, but we could
keep it in the executable itself.  Furthermore, while we are on this way,
couldn't we just manipulate the code segment of the user process into a
ring 0 one?  Let us think about this possibility.

<H4>User Processes at Ring 0?</H4>

<P>During reading, you might have thought about the question how the processor
knows which privilege the currently executed code has, and where it keeps
this information.  This is pretty simple in protected mode:  somewhere in
memory there are two tables that describe the location, size and properties
of each memory segment.  They are called global descriptor table (GDT) and
local descriptor table (LDT).  While the GDT describes system wide
structures, there is usually an LDT for each process in the system.  Two
special registers of the CPU, GDTR and LDTR, point to the beginning of the
tables.  Each table is an array with elements of eight bytes in size.  The
index into these arrays is fairly simple:  it is formed from the upper 13
bits of the 16 bit segment registers (CS, DS, ES, SS, FS, GS).  Bit 2 of
these registers distinguishes between LDT and GDT, and the two lowest bits
describe the current privilege the CPU is running.  What is most important
is that any segment descriptor in the tables also contains two bits that
determine the privilege level the code runs under.

<P>So the way to go seems clear:  get the content of the CS register, find the
corresponding GDT or LDT entry, and switch the privilege bits to ring 0.
This is possible.  However, this game will likely end very fast with a trap
and the register display on the text mode screen.  Why?


<P>We have seen in figure 3 that privileged ring 0 code will never execute
less privileged code.  However, certain system or application DLLs required
by the user program still have ring 3 level.  So the unfortunate
consequence is:  if your user program has privileges, it will lose the
ability to call several system functions.  The immediately upcoming flash
of an idea of promoting the system and user DLLs to the same level as well,
is hopefully not meant seriously, as it will end up with all software
running privileged.

<P>It therefore appears that any trick to raise the privilege of the user
process introduces more problems rather than solving them.	Let us try to
approach the problem from a totally different side.  Maybe we could reduce
the overhead of performing functions in a device driver. A Back Door into a
Driver: DevHlp_DynamicAPI

<P>Time to dive a bit deeper into a device driver.  The kernel provides a set
of routines known as device helper functions to a device driver.	One of
these helpers appears particularly attractive, as it promises to create a
ring 0 gate directly into a device driver.  So the idea is to build the I/O
functions into the driver and create such a dynamic API entry point.  This
will return a GDT selector that a user process can enter with an indirect
intersegment call instruction.  Estimating the overhead, this should be
considerably faster than the bureaucratic way of TESTCFG.SYS.

<P>At least that's how it works in theory.

<P>In fact, I programmed it this way, and it worked, but it did not even reach
the slow speed of TESTCFG.SYS.  Careful single stepping showed the
following:	the DevHlp_DynamicAPI  created the call gate, but the gate did
not point straight to the driver routine I wrote for the I/O access.
Instead, it pointed to somewhere in the kernel, into a routine DYNAM_API_4.
This entry point then performed almost all the fiddling I observed earlier
when tracing the ioctl of TESTCFG.SYS. What was even worse was what the "4"
in the label of the first routine told me.  I had broached a scarce
resource.  Analysis showed that there are only 16 of these entry points
available system wide, and mine was already the fifth one in use.  I have
not the slight idea about the other four clients, but it does not seem to
be a good idea to deliberately use up one of those expensive and rare
interfaces.

<P>But in principle, the idea was correct.

<H2>/DEV/FASTIO$ - the Final Way</H2>

<P>Okay.  We just managed to get a transforming (32-&gt;16bit) call gate, that
just happens to point to the wrong address.  It was a matter of seconds to
find the address of the corresponding GDT entry, and redirect it to the
expected position.  A kernel debugger is really a neat tool for the hacker.
It worked!

<P>At this point, calling the DevHlp_DynamicAPI function becomes useless, and
will just occupy a later unusable entry point in the kernel.  A quick look
into the list of device helper functions offers the function
DevHlp_AllocGDTSelector.  We acquire a default GDT selector for exclusive
use by the driver, and &quot;adjust&quot; it to form a 32-&gt;16 bit R3-&gt;R0 call gate into the I/O routine section of the driver.

<P>Have a look at the code fragment in the FASTIO$ driver (figure 4) which
does it all.

Figure 4: Initialization routine of FASTIO$ driver
</SMALL>

<P>Since a device driver is initialized in ring 3, this routine does not work
during startup.  Rather, the driver will call this code once the first time
some client opens the device.  Thus, to use the driver, a small routine
io_init() needs to be called first.  Refer to the file iolib.asm that comes
with this issue of EDM/2.

<P>A final improvement:  Usually, C code passes arguments on the stack. A call
gate can be configured to copy these parameters over to the new ring. But
why should we do this?	For really fast I/O access we pass the data in
registers.	This allows for direct replacement of I/O instructions in
assembler code by a simple indirect call as shown in figure 5. The address
of the indirect call is set up by the above mentioned io_init() procedure.

Figure 6: A C callable I/O function
</SMALL>

<P>The file iolib.asm  contains a set of functions c_inX() and c_outX() for
using I/O from any 32 bit compiler that supports the standard stack frame.
The files iolib.a and iolib.lib are precompiled versions; the file iolib.h
contains the C prototypes.

<P>In the complete driver, I gave up a small amount of the theoretically
reachable performance.	There are six basic I/O operations: IN and OUT
instructions exist for transferring bytes, 16 bit words and 32 bit long
words.  To become really fast, one would have to provide a separate GDT
selector for each of them.  In a typical OS/2 system, this should not be a
problem.  However, if now everyone would start to add more routines, each
with its own entry point, this resource could become rather quickly a
scarce one.  So I spent a function code, to be passed in the BX register,
to multiplex the six functions into a single GDT selector.	Refer to the
io_call entry point in the fastio_a.asm driver source file.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>The article demonstrated how a specialized device driver was used to assist
a user process in performing direct I/O.	The final overhead, compared to a
pure device driver or a DOS program implementation, is just the CPU cycles
of the indirect intersegment call through the call gate and the return
instruction.  Every other available method significantly adds a performance
penalty.  This also holds for I/O in a DOS Box, which was not explained in
this article.  It is to be expected, however, that this method will not be
available any longer in future Power PC systems, so avoid the demonstrated
trick unless absolutely necessary.

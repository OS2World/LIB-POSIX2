I think this applies only to high-speed games like your xpilot, <br>
Enlightment is unlikely to have this problem. <br>

<br>
This is something that - if at all - should be a part of the <br>
EMX runtime system, because this timer is a scarce resource, and <br>
mustn't be allocated exclusively. <br>

Not that I am aware of (that it has been discussed already). <br>
You'll now find a small port of oneko on the ported software page, which is<br>
the well-known cat hunting the mouse cursor. I've ported this as a quickie<br>
mainly to demonstate how one can replace common occurrences of setitimer(2)<br>
which was asked some days ago in this list.<br>
To explain how it works here, see the source code (<a href="ftp://set.gmd.de/pub/misc/XFree86OS2/ports/oneko-1.1.tgz">ftp://set.gmd.de/pub/misc/XFree86OS2/ports/oneko-1.1.tgz</a>)<br>
and the diffs (in the oneko.zip file):<br>
<p>
setitimer was used here to produce a periodic SIGALRM event faster than 1 sec.<br>
I replaced the setitimer call with a beginthread which runs in an endless<br>
loop (if this periodic timer is to be stopped in some other application,<br>
you have to end such a thread somehow, of course):<br>
	void itimerthread(void* dummy) {<br>
		while(1) {<br>
			_sleep2(numer_of_milliseconds);<br>
			/* call SIGALRM handler */<br>
			itimerflag = 1; /* see below */<br>
		}<br>
	}<br>
This thread _sleep2's for the specified interval time and would then call<br>
the signal function which is called by a SIGALRM signal. In this example,<br>
this is a no-op, because the side effect of SIGALRM is used here. Somewhere<br>
in the code is a pause() call, which waits until a signal happens. I<br>
replaced this pause() with a wait for a variable (an OS/2 semaphore would be<br>
cleaner, but this here is not critical):<br>
	while (itimerflag==0) DosSleep(0); /* could be DosSleep(1) as well? */<br>
	itimerflag = 0;<br>
and added a itimerflag=1 (see above) after the _sleep2 in the itimer thread.<br>
This will animate the neko cat.<br>
<p>
Such a mechanism might be worthwhile in many ports, maybe some of you can use<br>
it.<br>

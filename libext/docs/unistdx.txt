NAME chown - stub functions

SYNOPSIS

     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <sys/unistdx.h>

     int chown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);  /* stub fn */

DESCRIPTION

     chown() changes the owner and group of a file. (Meaningless on plain 
     OS/2 with FAT/HPFS.)
     I leave the details and provide the stub only! 
     If we assume we don't have any "owners" and "groups" - more precisely 
     that stat() will always indicate 'root' (0) - it is best to keep 
     the apps happy and make chown() always return 0 instead of indicating a 
     failure ... 


CONFORMING TO

    chown() conforms to SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN and SUSV2


IMPLEMENTATION 

     We do not implement, actually. However to be on the safe side for future 
     enhancements, we don't #define to 0: We create an entry point in 
     libextensions instead!

  TODO

     A link database, a _posixRedirRoot() function to emulate a Posix file system
     and real implementations. ;-)

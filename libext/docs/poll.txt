README for poll emulation:
=========================

Limitations, shortcomings:
(this list is unfortunately almost longer than the source ...)


 - things we can't "do" on our system (see docs)
 
 - thread-safe?
   :-(
 
 - what happens upon signals??
   %-\
 
 - limitated to 255(256?) descriptors currently
   "hardcoded" - it matches some EMX default values used for
   select. Could be easily raised in the poll sources!

 - passed no real world test.
   Ok, one might argue it didn't fail for one either ;-)

 - we don't know which handles contribute to the error -
   but poll() is supposed to tell the user 
   See source
   FIXED(?)

 - our capabilities WRT the different types of devices, etc.
   are limited by select()

 - not performance optimized.
   I guess some circumstances would demand a highly optimized
   implementation?!

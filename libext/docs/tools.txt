This is an attempt to list an unique environment of tools
we should use to develop this project.
Don't clutter this list with non-essential stuff ...


EMX 09d, fixpack 2 (whole distribution, not just the runtime)
  PGCC/2 in recent version (>2.95) should work as well

link386
  almost arbitrary version(?)

GNUMake - sufficiently bug free,
  we will try to avoid sophisticated features that are likely to break
  things.
  Some release levels of this project may contain Makefiles which
  depend on a Make tool to accept case sensitive rules.
  'x11make.exe' as supplied with the XFree86OS/2 development
  package is an example.

GNU FileUtils
  we use 'cp, 'rm', etc. instead of the native OS/2 commands
  (yes, the GNU ones are usually more powerful)
  Hobbes, LEO

GNU sed
  almost arbitrary version


More useful stuff which may appear in the Makefiles, but is
not mandatory:

(exuberant) ctags 
  To create the 'tags' files.

lxlite
  Executable compression

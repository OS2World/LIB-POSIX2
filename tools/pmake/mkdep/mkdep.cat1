     mmkkddeepp takes a set of flags for the C compiler and a list of C source
     files as arguments and constructs a set of include file dependencies
     which are written into the file _._d_e_p_e_n_d. An example of its use in a Make-
     file might be:

           CFLAGS= -O -I../include
           SRCS= file1.c file2.c

           depend:
                   mkdep ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}

     where the macro SRCS is the list of C source files and the macro CFLAGS
     is the list of flags for the C compiler.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Append to the output file, so that multiple mmkkddeepp's may be run
             from a single Makefile.

     --ff _f_i_l_e
             Write the include file dependencies to _f_i_l_e, instead of the de-
             fault _._d_e_p_e_n_d.

     --pp      Cause mmkkddeepp to produce dependencies of the form:

                   program: program.c

             so that subsequent makes will produce _p_r_o_g_r_a_m directly from its C
             module rather than using an intermediate _._o module.  This is use-
             ful for programs whose source is contained in a single module.

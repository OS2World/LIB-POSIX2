This is the P/2-Project's root directory. 

A forthcoming physical device driver will mount a POSIX-conforming 
file system hierarchy below this root directory. Afterwards you will
be able to do a simple 'make world', 'make install', to create a complete
posix-emulating subsystem.

Cf. manpage (hier.7bsd) for standard file system hierarchy information.
